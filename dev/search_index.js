NASA maintains two sources for solar system ephemeris data: the Horizons platform, and Generic SPICE Kernels updated (roughly) daily.\n\nNASA provides generic SPICE kernels with the most common solar system bodies. These kernels, which are available for download at https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/, allow you to use the SPICE Toolkit to query solar system ephemeris data locally in your kernel pool. You can fetch position and velocity data for spacecraft and solar system bodies, get shapes and mass parameters for celestial bodies, convert to and from different coordinate frames, and more. But how do you know which kernel to download? And how can you reliably access each kernel, and ensure your colleagues are downloading the same kernel?\n\nNASA also provides ephemeris through the Horizons ephemeris platform's REST API.  You can query for information about thousands of celestial bodies in our solar  system, but the REST interface may be unfamiliar, and the query responses require custom parsing for numerical applications. \n\nThe EphemerisSources.jl super-package allows users to idiomatically fetch  ephemeris data, and parse the results for Cartesian state vector information.  The ability to parse the ephemeris data in other formats, including observer  tables and osculating orbital elements, is not yet implemented.
