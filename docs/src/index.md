# `SPICEKernels.jl`

_Solar system ephemeris data for free!_

While `HorizonsAPI.jl` provides a precise interface which matches the JPL
Horizons API, `SPICEKernels.jl` provides an interface for **downloading**
General Kernel files from NASA JPL's public website. More documentation en
route!

!!! warning 
    More documentation will come, but for now, `SPICEKernels` only has
    humble [docstrings](docstrings)! For more information, take a look at the
    project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cadojo/SPICEKernels.jl/).
    There, and in docstrings, you'll find a recurring warning which is reiterated
    here: this project is not affiliated with or endorsed by NASA, JPL, Caltech, or
    any other organization!
