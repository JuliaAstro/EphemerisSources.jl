# `HorizonsEphemeris.jl`

_Solar system ephemeris data for free!_

While `HorizonsAPI.jl` provides a precise interface which matches the JPL Horizons API,
`HorizonsEphemeris.jl` provides a more user-friendly way to request solar system ephemeris
data. At this time, only Cartesian state vector ephemeris data is available
through the `HorizonsEphemeris.jl` interface.
