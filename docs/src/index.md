# `HorizonsEphemeris.jl`

_Solar system ephemeris data for free!_

While `HorizonsAPI.jl` provides a precise interface which matches the JPL Horizons API,
`HorizonsEphemeris.jl` provides a more user-friendly way to request solar system ephemeris
data. This package is in its early stages! The API will stabilize at `v1.0`. For now, 
**treat minor version bumps as breaking changes**. Patch updates are non-breaking changes.

!!! warning 
    More documentation will come, but for now, `HorizonsEphemeris` only has
    humble [docstrings](docstrings)! For more information, take a look at the
    project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cadojo/HorizonsEphemeris.jl/). There,
    and in docstrings, you'll find a recurring warning which is reiterated here:
    this project is not affiliated with or endorsed by NASA, JPL, Caltech, or any
    other organization!
