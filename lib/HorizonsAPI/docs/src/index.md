# `HorizonsAPI.jl`

_Solar system ephemeris data for free!_

This project aims to implement the publicly accessible REST API for JPL's
[HORIZONS](https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.html) ephemeris platform. Once
development is complete, this package will allow you to download physical
attribute information, position and velocity data, binary files, and more from
HORIZONS.
