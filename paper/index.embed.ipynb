    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Students and professionals in astronomy, astrodynamics, astrophysics, and other related fields often download and parse solar system ephemeris data from two major providers: [Generic JPL SPICE Kernels](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/), and [JPL Horizons](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/). SPICE Kernels are typically read through the SPICE Toolkit, which is available in a variety of programming languages, include the C Programming Language with `CSPICE` \\[@cspice\\]. The Julia packages [`CSPICE_jll.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/CSPICE_jll.jl) and [`SPICE.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/SPICE.jl) expose many `CSPICE` functions through Julia functions. Julia users can load and interact with SPICE kernels through methods such as `SPICE.furnsh` and `SPICE.spkez`. Horizons data is available through a variety of methods, including email, command-line, graphical web interfaces, and a [REST API](https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/horizons.html) \\[@horizons\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper introduces several packages which allow users to download and process ephemeris data idomatically, all from within Julia: `SPICEApplications.jl`, `SPICEKernels.jl`, `SPICEBodies.jl`, `HorizonsAPI.jl` and `HorizonsEphemeris.jl`. Through the use of these packages, users can share replicatable code which automatically fetches publicly available ephemeris data, as opposed to manually including ephemeris data files with their source code distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statement of Need\n",
    "\n",
    "While ephemeris users have all of the tools they need to fetch and parse ephemeris data within Julia, they do not have the tools to do so *simply* or *idiomatically*. \\[@sec-need-horizons\\] and \\[@sec-need-spice\\] present the research needs filled by each of the five packages introduced in this paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JPL HORIZONS\n",
    "\n",
    "The two HORIZONS-related packages presented in this paper — [`HorizonsAPI.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/HorizonsAPI.jl) and [`HorizonsEphemeris.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/HorizonsEphemeris.jl) — are respectively the first Julia packages to precisely match the REST API with tab-completion through static keyword arguments, and the first to offer automatic response parsing into `NamedTuple` types. The `NamedTuple` output of `HorizonsEphemeris.ephemeris`, the top-level method for fetching Cartesian state vectors from the HORIZONS platform, allows for easy plotting, file-saving, and `DataFrame` construction. Both `HorizonsAPI.jl` and `HorizonsEphemeris.jl` offer users a simple, repeatable way to query and parse HORIZONS ephemeris data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JPL SPICE\n",
    "\n",
    "The three SPICE-related packages presented in this paper — [`SPICEApplications.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/SPICEApplications.jl), [`SPICEKernels.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/SPICEKernels.jl), and [`SPICEBodies.jl`](https://github.com/cadojo/SPICEBodies.jl) — provide idiomatic kernel fetching, inspection, and caching from within Julia. While SPICE Toolkit executables were *bundled* in Julia through [`CSPICE_jll`](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/CSPICE_jll.jl), they have not been previously *exposed* through Julia functions. `SPICEApplications.jl` wraps each executable with a Julia function, allowing users to easily call SPICE Toolkit executables within their Julia programs, just as they can with `CSPICE` routines wrapped in [`SPICE.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/SPICE.jl).\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia users interact with SPICE kernels by downloading publicly-available a[Generic Kernels](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/), and parsing the data using `SPICE.jl`, or another ephemeris parsing source. This workflow requires that users know how to find the correct generic kernels for their chosen application, and that they know how to use CSPICE functions to retrieve their desired data. `SPICEKernels.jl` and `SPICEBodies.jl` offer idiomatic interfaces to ephemeris fetching and parsing parsing respectively. Continuous integration in the [`SPICEKernels.jl` repository](https://github.com/cadojo/SPICEKernels.jl) multiple times daily, and automatically exports all available generic kernels as variables in Julia. SPICE Toolkit executables (provided by `SPICEApplications.jl`) are used to retrieve a description of each kernel’s contents, and place that description in the Julia variable’s docstring. As a result, users can use tab-completion and Julia’s built-in documentation tools to inspect kernel contents, and download the correct kernel for their application. Once each kernel is downloaded and loaded into the SPICE kernel pool with `SPICE.jl`, users can use `SPICEBodies.jl` to idiomatically fetch data at a provided instance in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed usage examples, consult the common [documentation site](https://ephemeris.loopy.codes) for all of the packages presented in this paper. The code examples below show how a user may retrieve data from the HORIZONS platform, inspect a SPICE kernel before downloading it, and retrieve Cartesian state data at an instance in time.\n",

Support for other SPICE kernel management packages, such as [`Ephemerides.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaSpaceMissionDesign/Ephemerides.jl), may be added in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the packages in this paper which interface with the JPL HORIZONS ephemeris platform, the [`HORIZONS.JL`](https://github.com/PerezHz/HORIZONS.jl) package offers simplified interfaces for constructing and sending queries to the JPL HORIZONS REST API.\n",
