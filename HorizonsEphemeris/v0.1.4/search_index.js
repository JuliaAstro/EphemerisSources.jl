You can query the ephemeris function with any solar system body name, or NAIF code; HorizonsEphemeris uses SPICE under the hood to return the appropriate Horizons-compatible NAIF code. After providing the desired solar system body, specify the start time, stop time, and step size for which you want ephemeris data. You'll receive a NamedTuple in return. The labels for each key can be changed with the header keyword. For example, to get rid of the Unicode character keys, specify header=[:MJD, :Calendar, :X, :Y, :Z, :DX, :DY, :DZ]. This NamedTuple output is automatically compatible with DataFrames. Finally, use the file keyword argument to write the resulting ephemeris data, with labels, to a provided filename as a CSV file.\n\njulia> using Plots, Dates, HorizonsEphemeris\n\njulia> earth = let start = now() - Year(50), stop = now() + Year(50), step = Day(1)\n           @time ephemeris(\"earth\", start, stop, step; wrt=\"jupiter\", units=\"AU-D\");\n       end\n  # 6.376672 seconds (19.78 k allocations: 21.253 MiB)\n\njulia> plot(\n           earth.X, earth.Y;\n           aspect_ratio = 1,\n           linewidth = 1.5,\n           border = :none,\n           size = (600, 600),\n           dpi = 200,\n           grid = false,\n           axis = nothing,\n           title = \"\",\n           label=:none,\n           color = \"green\",\n           background=:transparent,\n       )\n\n(Image: )\n\nLicense\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 Joe Carpinelli\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
